## Dataset

We used this dataset from Kaggle in the project

https://www.kaggle.com/code/iamhungundji/book-summary-genre-prediction/notebook

Steps on how we combined and cleaned it up are located under Data/model.ipynb file.

## Starting up a virtual environment
For mac write this in the terminal: python3 -m venv .venv

For windows write this: python -m venv .venv

Then select interperter using Cmd/Cntrl + Shift + P and then open a new terminal.

Then it is easy to download all required requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt.

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments

## How to run the code

First clone the repository and start up a virtual environment (instructions in section above). Then run

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To install tkinter (if it fails to work) then follow [this YouTube tutorial right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSCzB3zg9A4).

Then simply navigate to the View folder and run

```python recommendation_app.py```

A window will pop up where you can search for a book title to get recommendations. To test out try the title "Max and Felix" (without the quotation marks).
